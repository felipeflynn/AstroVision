# AstroVision - Horoscope App

## Description
AstroVision is a horoscope application that provides accurate predictions and insights for the zodiac signs. This application follows the MVVM architecture and best clean code practices to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Key Features

- **MVVM Architecture and Clean Code**: AstroVision is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and adheres to clean code best practices for organized and efficient development.

- **Fragments**: We utilize Fragments to create a dynamic and modular user experience.

- **Navigation Component**: Efficiently manage navigation between fragments using the Navigation Component.

- **Gradle KTS**: The build file uses Kotlin Script (KTS) format for more expressive and concise Gradle configuration.

- **Dependency Injection**: We employ a dependency injection system for easier component management and unit testing.

- **StateFlow and Coroutines**: StateFlow is used to manage data flow reactively, and Coroutines are applied for asynchronous tasks.

- **RecyclerView**: To display lists of content, we leverage RecyclerView for efficiency and performance.

- **Retrofit, Interceptors, and Mappers**: With Retrofit, we make API calls to fetch accurate horoscope data. Interceptors are used to manipulate requests and responses, and Mappers convert data into usable objects.

- **Intents**: Intents are used to initiate external activities, such as sharing horoscopes on social media.

- **CameraX**: We implement CameraX for camera and photography features in the app.

- **Animations**: Animations are incorporated to enhance the user experience, such as the coin flip effect when switching between signs.

- **Unit Testing and UITest**: Unit and UI tests are conducted to ensure the quality and stability of the app.
